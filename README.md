# Mastermind

The object of MASTERMIND is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs, but this time instead of coloured pegs we use numbers.

The mastermind code checks of several things:
  ~The code length that the user inputs.
  ~The correct number of digits that are present in the code
  ~The correct number of digits that are present in the right position
